Presented research on different approaches to combining optimization techniques with satisfiability solving at the 2nd EuroYoung Workshop in Optimization and Data Science.

## Presentation Overview

This workshop talk explores two distinct paradigms for integrating optimization algorithms with SAT/MaxSAT solving approaches. The presentation compares different strategies for leveraging both paradigms to solve complex combinatorial problems.

## Key Points

* Comparison of optimization-first vs. satisfiability-first approaches
* Integration strategies for hybrid optimization/SAT solving
* Performance characteristics of each paradigm
* Applications to discrete optimization and constraint satisfaction

## Focus

The work demonstrates that choosing the appropriate paradigm and integration strategy can lead to significant performance improvements compared to standalone approaches.
