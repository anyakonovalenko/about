This paper presents novel methods for dynamically tuning tabu search algorithm parameters using machine learning techniques. Instead of using fixed parameter configurations, the approach adapts parameters based on problem-solving progress.

## Key Contributions

- Adaptive parameter ML-based tuning system for tabu search
- 5% improvement in optimization performance over static parameter configurations
- Statistical significance testing of results
- Real-world validation on discrete optimization problems

## Methodology

The approach uses machine learning models trained on historical optimization runs to predict optimal parameter settings during algorithm execution, enabling dynamic parameter adjustment.
