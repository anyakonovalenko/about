This paper presents an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting delivery route deviations in last-mile logistics. The study analyzes over 20,000 historical routes and evaluates multiple neural architectures including LSTM, CNN, and Transformer models.

## Key Contributions

- Comprehensive analysis of 20,000+ historical delivery routes
- Evaluation of three neural architecture approaches (LSTM, CNN, Transformers)
- Achieved 19% improvement in prediction accuracy over existing baseline methods
- Practical application for Norwegian logistics company operations

## Results

The proposed ML pipeline successfully identifies factors affecting route deviations with significant accuracy improvements compared to traditional prediction methods.
