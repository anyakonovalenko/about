This paper develops machine learning methods to identify hidden or implicit constraints affecting vehicle routing problem solutions. The approach uses LSTM-based classification to detect and locate constraint violations that may not be explicitly specified in problem formulations.

## Key Contributions

- LSTM-based system for detecting hidden constraint violations in VRP solutions
- Comprehensive classification of constraint types: time windows, capacity, precedence
- Methodology to pinpoint exact violation locations in routes
- Integration of tacit driver knowledge into optimization algorithms

## Applications

The identified hidden constraints can be integrated back into optimization algorithms to improve solution quality and better reflect real-world operational constraints.
