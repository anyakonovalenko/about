This paper develops a reinforcement learning approach for solving dynamic vehicle routing problems in real-time. The study systematically analyzes which state space components are most critical for effective RL-based routing decisions.

## Key Contributions

- RL-based algorithm for dynamic vehicle routing with real-time adaptability
- Systematic ablation studies on state space component importance
- 15% efficiency improvement over greedy heuristics
- Improved robustness under operational disruptions

## Methodology

Multi-agent RL approach combined with optimization heuristics, with detailed analysis of how different state representations affect solution quality and convergence behavior.
