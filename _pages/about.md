I am a Research Scientist and ML Engineer with a PhD in Machine Learning, specializing in applying advanced machine learning techniques to complex optimization problems. My research focuses on bridging the gap between theoretical machine learning and practical applications in operations research, particularly in logistics and route optimization.

## Research Interests

My work explores the intersection of machine learning and optimization, with particular emphasis on:

- **Machine Learning for Optimization**: Developing ML-based methods to solve and analyze complex optimization problems
- **Deep Learning**: Applying LSTM, CNN, and Transformer architectures to structured prediction problems
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Using RL to improve optimization algorithms and decision-making processes
- **Last-Mile Delivery**: Predicting and analyzing route deviations in delivery logistics
- **Vehicle Routing Problems**: Identifying hidden constraints and improving solution quality
- **Parameter Tuning**: Adaptive ML-based methods for optimizing algorithm parameters

## Background

I completed my PhD at Molde University College, Norway, where I investigated "Advancing the Use of Machine Learning for Complex Optimization Problems." During my doctoral studies, I spent six months as a Visiting Researcher at Imperial College London, collaborating with leading researchers in optimization and machine learning.

Prior to my PhD, I worked as a Software Engineer at OneReach.ai and Panenco, where I developed production-grade systems and gained practical experience in deploying ML solutions at scale. I also have experience building scalable cloud infrastructure on AWS and implementing CI/CD pipelines.

## Technical Expertise

**Programming Languages**: Python, SQL, JavaScript, AWS

**Machine Learning & Statistics**: PyTorch, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, hypothesis testing, regression, classification, time series analysis

**Deep Learning Architectures**: LSTM, CNN, Transformers

**Specialized Areas**:
- Reinforcement Learning and policy optimization
- Operations Research and metaheuristics
- Vehicle routing and logistics optimization
- Constraint satisfaction and satisfiability solving

**Development & DevOps**: Git, CI/CD, Jupyter Notebook, LaTeX, Docker, Kubernetes

## Teaching Experience

I have designed and delivered comprehensive curricula for Machine Learning and Statistics courses, teaching 100+ students each at Molde University College. My teaching approach combines theoretical foundations with practical, hands-on experience using modern Python libraries and real-world datasets.
